# Driver_Monitoring_System
In the modern day, with the increase in the number of vehicles plying on the roads, traffic accidents have grown significantly in number. One of the primary causes of traffic accidents is drunk driving or driving under influence (DUI) or drowsed driver.Drowsiness detection is a safety technology that can prevent accidents that are caused by drivers who fell asleep while driving. The objective of this intermediate Python project is to build a drowsiness detection system that will detect that a personâ€™s eyes are closed for a few seconds. This system will alert the driver when drowsiness is detected.
